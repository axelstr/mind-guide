# Patient Record: Michael Torres

## Initial Context
Michael Torres, a 32-year-old graphic designer, sought help due to experiencing intense mood swings, unstable relationships, and a persistent fear of abandonment. He reports feeling "empty" most of the time and has a history of self-harm.

## Clinician's Summary
After five sessions, it's evident that Michael exhibits signs more consistent with Borderline Personality Disorder rather than Bipolar Disorder:

1. Emotional Instability:
   - Intense and highly variable moods, often shifting within hours or minutes
   - Chronic feelings of emptiness
   - Inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger

2. Interpersonal Relationships:
   - Pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships
   - Frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment
   - Alternating between idealizing and devaluing partners and friends

3. Self-Image:
   - Markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self
   - Impulsivity in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating)

4. Behavior:
   - Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, or threats, or self-mutilating behavior
   - Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood

Unlike Bipolar Disorder, Michael's mood changes are rapid, often triggered by interpersonal events, and don't meet the duration criteria for manic or depressive episodes.

## Response to Medication
- Week 1-2 on Fluoxetine (20mg/day): Mild improvement in depressive symptoms, but increased anxiety
- Week 3-4: Dosage adjusted to 40mg/day, some stabilization of mood, but still experiencing rapid shifts
- Week 5-6: Addition of low-dose Aripiprazole (2mg/day) for mood stabilization
- Week 7-8: Modest improvement in impulsivity and anger outbursts, but persistent relationship difficulties

Note: While medications have shown some benefit, the primary recommendation is for Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to address the core symptoms of Borderline Personality Disorder.
