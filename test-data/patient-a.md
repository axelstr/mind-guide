# Patient Record: Sarah Johnson

## Initial Context
Sarah Johnson, a 28-year-old marketing executive, sought help due to experiencing extreme mood swings over the past year. She reports periods of high energy and productivity lasting several days, followed by episodes of deep depression and inability to function at work.

## Clinician's Summary
After three sessions, it's evident that Sarah exhibits classic signs of Bipolar Disorder Type I:

1. Manic Episodes:
   - Decreased need for sleep (2-3 hours/night for 4-5 days)
   - Increased goal-directed activity (starting multiple projects at once)
   - More talkative than usual, speaking rapidly
   - Flight of ideas and racing thoughts
   - Excessive involvement in risky activities (impulsive spending, sexual indiscretions)

2. Depressive Episodes:
   - Profound sadness and emptiness lasting 2-3 weeks
   - Significant weight loss due to decreased appetite
   - Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day
   - Fatigue and loss of energy
   - Feelings of worthlessness and excessive guilt
   - Diminished ability to concentrate
   - Recurrent thoughts of death

## Response to Medication
- Week 1-2 on Lithium (900mg/day): Mild improvement in mood stability, some gastrointestinal side effects
- Week 3-4: Dosage adjusted to 1200mg/day, noticeable reduction in manic symptoms
- Week 5-6: Addition of Quetiapine (300mg/day) for depressive symptoms
- Week 7-8: Significant improvement in overall mood stability, sleep patterns normalizing
