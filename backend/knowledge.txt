## Bipolar Disorder: Diagnosis and Treatment

### Diagnosis

Bipolar disorder is characterized by alternating episodes of mania (or hypomania) and depression. Diagnosis is based on the DSM-5 criteria:

1. Manic Episode:
   - Elevated, expansive, or irritable mood
   - Increased goal-directed activity or energy
   - Lasting at least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary)

2. Hypomanic Episode:
   - Similar to manic episode but less severe
   - Lasting at least 4 consecutive days

3. Major Depressive Episode:
   - Depressed mood or loss of interest/pleasure
   - Lasting at least 2 weeks

Bipolar I: At least one manic episode
Bipolar II: At least one hypomanic episode and one major depressive episode

### Treatment

1. Mood Stabilizers:
   - Lithium (e.g., Lithobid): 600-1200 mg/day
   - Valproic acid (e.g., Depakene): 750-1750 mg/day
   - Carbamazepine (e.g., Tegretol): 400-1600 mg/day
   - Lamotrigine (e.g., Lamictal): 100-400 mg/day

2. Antipsychotics:
   - Quetiapine (e.g., Seroquel): 300-800 mg/day
   - Olanzapine (e.g., Zyprexa): 5-20 mg/day
   - Risperidone (e.g., Risperdal): 1-6 mg/day
   - Aripiprazole (e.g., Abilify): 10-30 mg/day

3. Antidepressants (used cautiously, risk of triggering mania):
   - SSRIs: Fluoxetine, Sertraline, Escitalopram
   - SNRIs: Venlafaxine, Duloxetine

4. Psychotherapy:
   - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
   - Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT)
   - Family-Focused Therapy

5. Lifestyle modifications:
   - Regular sleep schedule
   - Stress management techniques
   - Avoiding alcohol and recreational drugs

Treatment plans should be individualized based on the patient's specific symptoms, episode type, and response to medications. Regular monitoring and adjustments are crucial for optimal management.
